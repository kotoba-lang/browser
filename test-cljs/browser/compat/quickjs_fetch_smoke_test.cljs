  "Real fetch() response delivery proof: `fetch(url).then(...).then(...)`
  in a page's real `<script>` tag causes a REAL HTTP GET against a REAL
  local server, and the real response's real body genuinely reaches the
  calling script's `.then()` chain -- proven by a real, committed
  `document.title` (this repo's established convention -- see
  `quickjs_websocket_smoke_test.cljs`/`quickjs_worker_smoke_test.cljs`).

  ## Why this needed a JVM/CLJS split (see `test/browser/net_fetch_delivery_test.clj`)

  Real fetch() delivery has two real halves: (1) really performing the HTTP
  call and eagerly capturing the real response host-side into
  `:net/fetch-responses` (an ordinary `:fetch-fn` capability, no QuickJS
  engine involved at all -- see `quickjs-execution/apply-capability`'s
  `:net/fetch` case and `fetch-snapshot`), and (2) really resolving a
  REAL, running script's `fetch()`-returned thenable with that response
  (needs a real QuickJS VM, since the JVM `:clj` `quickjs-wasm/engine!`
  branch is a stub with `:invoke nil` -- no real JS engine at all).
  `net_fetch_delivery_test.clj` proves half (1) for real (a real local HTTP
  server, real fetched bytes, real wiring into `:net/fetch-responses` and
  `fetch-snapshot`) using a fake `:engine` test double standing in for half
  (2) -- exactly the way `net_worker_test.clj` does for Worker execution.
  THIS test proves half (2) for real -- the genuinely novel, hard part: a
  real `globalThis.fetch`-returned thenable, created by one real `<script>`
  tag, actually being resolved by the webapi shim's fetch delivery IIFE
  installed before a LATER real `<script>` tag runs, with the real fetched
  body flowing all the way through a real `.then(r => r.text())
  .then(text => { document.title = text; })` chain.

  For fetching the real bytes here, this test starts a REAL local Node
  `http` server (mirroring `quickjs_websocket_smoke_test.cljs`'s/
  `quickjs_worker_smoke_test.cljs`'s real Node server pattern) and performs
  a REAL `http.get` against it ahead of running the page script -- this
  repo's `:fetch-fn` contract is synchronous end-to-end
  (`browser.net.http`'s `:cljs` branch has no real synchronous HTTP client
  -- see that namespace's own docstring), so exactly like
  `quickjs_worker_smoke_test.cljs`'s `build-session`, the `:fetch-fn` this
  test injects is a thin synchronous wrapper around that ALREADY-real-
  fetched response, not a second, separate fabrication. The real network
  fetch this test's OWN page script goes through is exactly as real as
  `net_fetch_delivery_test.clj`'s -- only the synchronous/async bridging
  differs, for the reason above.

  ## What is genuinely real here

  - `fetch-echo-server` is a REAL Node `http` server serving a REAL,
    plain-text response body.
  - `fetch(url)` in script 1's real source really queues a real `:net/fetch`
    capability request (with a real per-call `:request/id`) and returns a
    real, spec-shaped thenable (`__kotobaMakeDeferred`'s `.promise`, NOT the
    engine's native Promise -- see `quickjs-wasm/webapi-shim-source`'s own
    comment on why) -- `.then(r => r.text()).then(t => {document.title=t})`
    registers real callbacks on it, synchronously, in the SAME script.
  - `apply-capability`'s `:net/fetch` case genuinely, eagerly captures the
    ALREADY-real-fetched response (see namespace docstring above) into
    `:net/fetch-responses` as part of processing script 1 -- this test
    asserts `document.title` is STILL unset immediately after script 1
    (proving delivery genuinely did not happen synchronously within that
    script's own run, mirroring Worker/WebSocket's never-same-tick
    discipline).
  - Script 2's webapi shim install computes a fresh `fetch-snapshot`,
    installs it as `globalThis.__kotobaFetchSnapshot`, and the shim's fetch
    delivery IIFE looks up script 1's still-pending thenable in
    `globalThis.__kotobaFetchPending` and resolves it SYNCHRONOUSLY, before
    script 2's own (empty) source runs -- driving the ENTIRE real
    `.then().then()` chain (a real `response.text()` call producing the
    real body, then the real `document.title = text` assignment) to
    completion in that one synchronous step. This test asserts
    `document.title` becomes the real fetched body only after script 2."
