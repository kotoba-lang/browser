(ns browser.compat.quickjs-websocket-onclose-smoke-test
  "Real page-script proof that a genuine PEER-INITIATED `ws.onclose` fires
  EXACTLY ONCE across multiple `<script>` tags, mirroring
  `quickjs_websocket_onopen_smoke_test.cljs`'s real-connection infra.

  Before this cycle's fix, `browser.net.websocket`'s real `closed?` atom
  (set true by a real `onClose`/`onclose` event on either backend) never
  resets once true, and `quickjs-execution/websocket-connection-snapshot`
  recomputed the plain, JS-visible `:closed` key from that raw atom on
  EVERY script tag with zero dedup -- unlike the `:opened`/`:error`
  sibling fields fixed the two cycles before this one. A real peer-
  initiated close (this test's server sends an UNSOLICITED real RFC6455
  close frame right after the handshake, simulating a server closing the
  connection on its own -- as opposed to a `ws.close()` the SAME script
  already called, which the webapi shim flips `readyState` for locally)
  would fire `ws.onclose` on EVERY later `<script>` tag forever instead
  of exactly once. This test proves BOTH halves of the fix: a real close
  genuinely reaches `ws.onclose` on the first snapshot install after it
  is observed (script 2), AND does NOT fire again on a later script tag
  (script 3) now that `:websocket/closed`'s dedup set has recorded it as
  already delivered -- even though the real underlying `closed?` atom
  still reports `true` forever."
