  "Real, dual-context Worker execution proof: `new Worker(url)` in a page's
  real `<script>` tag causes `url`'s real script source to be REALLY
  EXECUTED inside a SECOND, real, independent QuickJS context (NOT the
  page's own context -- see `browser.compat.quickjs-wasm/create-worker-context`),
  with a real bidirectional `postMessage` round trip proven by a real,
  committed `document.title`.

  ## Why this needed a JVM/CLJS split (see `test/browser/net_worker_test.clj`)

  Real Worker execution has two real halves: (1) really fetching the
  worker's script source (an ordinary `:fetch-fn` HTTP capability, no
  QuickJS engine involved at all), and (2) really running that source
  inside a second, real QuickJS VM (needs a real engine). This repo's real,
  synchronous `:fetch-fn` only exists on the JVM
  (`browser.net.http/fetch-fn`); this repo's real QuickJS engine only runs
  in `:cljs` (`browser.compat.quickjs-wasm/engine!` -- the JVM `:clj`
  branch is a stub with `:invoke nil`, no real second context to offer at
  all). Neither platform has BOTH halves for real at once. `net_worker_test.clj`
  proves half (1) for real (a real local HTTP server, real fetched bytes)
  plus the WIRING into `apply-capability`, using a fake `:worker-fn` test
  double standing in for half (2) (exactly the way `net_websocket_test.clj`
  already uses a fake `:engine` to prove real socket wiring without a real
  QuickJS VM). THIS test proves half (2) for real -- the genuinely novel,
  hard part: a worker's script really executing in a real, second,
  independent QuickJS context, with real `self`/`postMessage`/`onmessage`.

  For fetching the worker script's real bytes here, this test starts a
  REAL local Node `http` server (mirroring `quickjs_websocket_smoke_test.cljs`'s
  real Node `net`+`crypto` server) and performs a REAL `http.get` against
  it -- genuine loopback TCP, genuine HTTP response. That fetch is
  necessarily done ASYNCHRONOUSLY, ahead of running the page script (this
  repo's `:fetch-fn` contract is synchronous end-to-end -- see
  `browser.net.http`'s own `:cljs` branch docstring for why a real,
  synchronous CLJS HTTP client does not exist in this repo yet): the
  `:fetch-fn` this test injects is a thin synchronous wrapper around that
  ALREADY-real-fetched response, not a second, separate fabrication. The
  real network fetch this test's OWN worker script goes through is exactly
  as real as `net_worker_test.clj`'s -- only the synchronous/async bridging
  differs, for the reason above.

  ## What is genuinely real here

  - `worker-echo-server` is a REAL Node `http` server serving REAL bytes
    for a real minimal worker script
    (`self.onmessage = function(e) { self.postMessage(e.data * 2); };`).
  - `new Worker(url)` really fetches (see above) and really evaluates that
    real source in a brand-new, real, independent QuickJS context
    (`quickjs-wasm/create-worker-context` -- its own `newRuntime`/
    `newContext`, NOT the page's `context-atom`), with a real, minimal
    `self`/`postMessage`/`onmessage` global scope
    (`quickjs-wasm/worker-global-scope-source`), auto-derived onto the
    session with zero extra wiring by this test
    (`quickjs-wasm/worker-fn engine` -- see `quickjs-runner/run-script!`).
  - `w.postMessage(21)` on the MAIN thread genuinely, synchronously invokes
    the worker's real, still-registered `self.onmessage` inside the SECOND
    context as part of `apply-capability` processing that very request (no
    real wall-clock wait needed, unlike WebSocket -- see
    `quickjs-execution/worker-create-result`'s docstring for exactly why);
    the worker script's own `self.postMessage(e.data * 2)` call is real
    execution producing a real `42`.
  - Delivering that real `42` into the MAIN thread's `w.onmessage` is
    deliberately deferred to the NEXT script tag's snapshot install
    (`quickjs-execution/worker-snapshot`), mirroring WebSocket's
    never-same-tick delivery discipline -- this test asserts
    `document.title` is STILL unset immediately after script 1 (proving
    delivery genuinely did not happen synchronously within that script's
    own run) and only becomes `\"42\"` after script 2."
