  "Verifies the REAL half of Worker execution this repo can prove on the
   JVM: a REAL local HTTP server (JDK `com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer`,
   the exact same pattern `net_http_test.clj` uses) serves a worker
   script's real bytes, `browser.net.http/fetch-fn` really fetches them
   over a real socket, and
   `browser.compat.quickjs-execution/apply-capability` really threads that
   real, fetched source into whatever `:worker-fn` the engine provides --
   proving the WIRING (real fetch -> real source -> real second-context
   creation hook -> real reply queued for the next script tag's
   `:worker/snapshot`) end to end.

   What this suite CANNOT prove (and does not claim to): the JVM
   `browser.compat.quickjs-wasm` engine has no real second QuickJS context
   to offer at all (`engine!`'s `:clj` branch is a stub, `:invoke nil` --
   see that namespace) -- there is no real JS engine on the JVM in this
   repo, full stop, independent of this change. So `:worker-fn` here is a
   FAKE, request-capturing test double standing in for
   `browser.compat.quickjs-wasm/worker-fn`'s real, engine-backed
   implementation, exactly the way `net_websocket_test.clj`'s
   `quickjs-websocket-wiring-moves-real-bytes-through-apply-capability`
   uses a fake `:engine` to prove REAL socket wiring without a real
   QuickJS VM. The genuinely novel claim -- a worker's script REALLY
   executing inside a real, second, independent QuickJS context, and a
   real `self.onmessage`/`postMessage` round trip -- is proven only in
   `test-cljs/browser/compat/quickjs_worker_smoke_test.cljs`, the one
   platform where `quickjs-wasm`'s engine is real (see that namespace's
   own docstring for the JVM/real-engine split rationale)."
