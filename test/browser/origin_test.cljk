  ;; (a malicious or compromised server can return it verbatim in a
  ;; redirect Location header) -- without stripping userinfo, this engine's
  ;; origin model would compute the origin as
  ;; "https://victim.com@attacker.com" instead of the real
  ;; "https://attacker.com", silently breaking any cookie/permission-store
  ;; lookup keyed by host for such a URL.

  ;; compared the raw authority string verbatim, so a page navigating
  ;; between the implicit- and explicit-default-port form of the SAME
  ;; real URL would see its storage/cache/cookies silently split across
  ;; two "different" origins.
