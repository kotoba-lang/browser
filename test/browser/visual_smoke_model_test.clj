  "The visual smoke's assertions.

   Until 2026-08-04 nothing in the visual smoke path looked at anything
   visual. `browser.visual-smoke-check` asserts the built artifact exists,
   is over a megabyte and contains some marker strings; this test asserted
   text content, a commit count and a history event list. Between them they
   could not tell a correct render from a blank frame — and they did not:
   the fixture passed `overflow` as an ATTRIBUTE, which cssom.layout
   deliberately never reads (`:overflow` is CSS-only; only `scroll-top` is
   an attribute), so the \"scroll clipped content\" case the page exists to
   exercise emitted no clip at all, and the `<h1>` painted `#e6ebf5` on the
   page's own `#ffffff` background.

   So this asserts on the draw ops themselves — the same
   `:browser/draw-ops` vector `browser.desktop-backend`, `browser.devtools`
   and `browser.browser-use` all read, produced by the same
   `browser.core/load-html` the session runs."
