(ns browser.net-websocket-test
  "Verifies browser.net.websocket against a REAL local WebSocket server --
   no mocks, no external network calls, and (since the JDK ships a real
   WebSocket *client* but no server-side support at all) a hand-rolled,
   minimal RFC6455 server built directly on `java.net.ServerSocket`: it
   performs a real HTTP-Upgrade handshake (including a real
   `Sec-WebSocket-Accept` computation) and echoes back whatever real text
   frame it receives. Just enough RFC6455 to prove real bytes cross the
   wire and come back -- not a general WebSocket library.

   Coverage:
   - a bare `websocket-fn` round trip: connect, send, and receive the REAL
     echoed bytes back from the real server
   - several sends in one connection are received in order
   - a REAL text message the server deliberately fragments across 2 (and,
     adversarially, 3) real WebSocket frames (opcode 1 + FIN clear, then
     continuation frame(s) opcode 0, FIN set only on the last) is
     reassembled by `browser.net.websocket`'s `:clj` listener into the
     complete original string, not just its final fragment
   - a real close, reported back as `:closed? true` by a later drain
   - a real connection failure (closed port) surfacing as an error map,
     never as an uncaught exception
   - `browser.compat.quickjs-execution/apply-capability` wired to a REAL
     `:websocket-fn`: `:websocket/connect` + `:websocket/send` genuinely
     open a socket and send real bytes to the real server, and the
     REAL echoed reply shows up in the host-computed `:websocket/snapshot`
     that a later script evaluation would receive -- proving the wiring
     itself (not just the low-level client) moves real bytes, independent
     of the CLJS-only proof that a real `<script>` tag's callback actually
     fires (see `test-cljs/browser/compat/quickjs_websocket_smoke_test.cljs`)."
