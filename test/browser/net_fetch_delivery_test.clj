(ns browser.net-fetch-delivery-test
  "Verifies the REAL half of `fetch()` response delivery this repo can prove
   on the JVM: a REAL local HTTP server (JDK `com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer`,
   the exact same pattern `net_http_test.clj`/`net_worker_test.clj` use)
   serves a real response body, `browser.net.http/fetch-fn` really fetches it
   over a real socket, and `browser.compat.quickjs-execution/apply-capability`
   really captures that real response (status/headers/body) EAGERLY into
   `:net/fetch-responses` the instant it processes the `:net/fetch` request
   (mirroring `worker-create-result`'s eager-capture reasoning -- a real
   HTTP client call is itself synchronous/blocking, so there is nothing left
   to wait for), then really hands it to the NEXT `evaluate!` call's engine
   invocation as `:fetch/snapshot` (`quickjs-execution/fetch-snapshot`) --
   proving the WIRING (real fetch -> real response captured -> real snapshot
   delivered to the next script tag, outbox cleared) end to end.

   What this suite CANNOT prove (and does not claim to): the JVM
   `browser.compat.quickjs-wasm` engine has no real QuickJS VM to offer at
   all (`engine!`'s `:clj` branch is a stub, `:invoke nil` -- see that
   namespace), so there is no real `globalThis.fetch`/`.then()` JS shim
   running here, exactly the way `net_worker_test.clj` cannot prove a real
   second QuickJS context. The genuinely novel claim -- a real `fetch()`
   call's returned thenable actually being resolved (or rejected) by the
   webapi shim's fetch delivery IIFE, across two real `<script>` tags -- is
   proven only in
   `test-cljs/browser/compat/quickjs_fetch_smoke_test.cljs`, the one
   platform where `quickjs-wasm`'s engine is real (see that namespace's own
   docstring for the JVM/real-engine split rationale, mirroring
   `quickjs_worker_smoke_test.cljs`'s)."
