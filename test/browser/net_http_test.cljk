  "Verifies browser.net.http against a REAL local HTTP server (JDK
   com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer) -- no mocks, no external network calls.

   Coverage:
   - a bare fetch-fn round trip against a real socket (status + body)
   - a real redirect and a real 404 response passed through untouched
   - browser.session/navigate! wired end to end to a real fetch-fn, asserting
     the committed page actually contains the real server's HTML
   - a real connection failure (closed port) surfacing as a response/error,
     never as an uncaught exception, both at the fetch-fn level and through
     the whole navigate! session."
