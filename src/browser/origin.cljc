(def default-ports
  "Per-scheme default port -- RFC 6454 origin comparison (and the
   WHATWG URL spec's own port-normalization step) treats an explicit
   default port as equivalent to no port at all (`https://x` and
   `https://x:443` are the SAME origin), but this file previously
   compared the raw authority string verbatim, including any port,
   confirmed via direct REPL reproduction:
   `(same-origin? \"https://example.com\" \"https://example.com:443\")`
   returned false. This is more than cosmetic -- `origin`/`same-origin?`
   are the load-bearing primitives behind browser.net's fetch-cache
   credential partitioning, CORS Origin-header decisions, and
   :net/fetch permission checks, plus browser.storage's per-origin key
   partitioning, so a page that navigates between an implicit- and
   explicit-default-port form of the SAME real URL (explicit default
   ports show up in redirects, hand-authored links, and some server
   configs) would see its storage/cache/cookies silently split across
   two \"different\" origins."
