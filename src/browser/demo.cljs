  "kotoba-lang/browser's own runnable demo.

   Unlike dom-gpu's kotoba.wasm.demo-document (cascade+layout+paint only, no
   real JS), this demo drives the full stack this repo built up this
   session:

     browser.session/new-session   (real session, real webgl DomHost)
     -> browser.compat.quickjs-runner/quickjs-session-opts
                                    (real QuickJS WASM engine wired in as the
                                     session's :browser.session/script-runner)
     -> browser.session/ensure-script-engine!
                                    (starts the real WASM engine; a Promise
                                     in ClojureScript -- MUST be awaited
                                     before any load/navigate, see that var's
                                     docstring and
                                     browser.compat.quickjs-runner's)
     -> browser.session/load-html! (real HTML parse -> real cssom cascade ->
                                     real box-model/flexbox/grid/text-wrap
                                     layout -> real inline <script> executed
                                     by the real QuickJS VM, mutating
                                     document.title through the real
                                     dom/mutate capability path -- then the
                                     resulting ABI op batch is committed to
                                     the real host)
     -> kotoba.wasm.host.webgl      (the real DomHost: every ABI op the
                                     session emits is applied into this
                                     host's retained-tree state via
                                     kotoba.wasm.host/commit!, then painted
                                     for real onto <canvas> with WebGL rects
                                     + a 2D text overlay)

   Because the webgl host is wired in directly as :host on the session (not
   bolted on after the fact the way dom-gpu's own demo_document.cljs had
   to, since that demo never went through browser.session), painting
   happens automatically as part of every browser.session/load-html! call --
   session/commit-page! already calls kotoba.wasm.host/commit! on the page's
   real :browser/ops for us.

   ## Real networking: WebSocket, Worker, fetch()

   A later session on this repo built three more real capabilities into the
   underlying engine (browser.net.websocket, quickjs-wasm's real second-
   context Worker execution, and quickjs-wasm's __kotobaMakeDeferred-backed
   real fetch() delivery), each individually proven via isolated Node-based
   CLJS smoke tests (test-cljs/browser/compat/quickjs_websocket_smoke_test.cljs,
   quickjs_worker_smoke_test.cljs, quickjs_fetch_smoke_test.cljs). This demo
   now exercises all three live, in a real browser tab, against a REAL small
   local server (scripts/demo-server.js -- serves the SAME static public/
   files shadow-cljs's own devtools http server does, PLUS a /worker.js
   script, a /api/fetch-data endpoint, and a /ws-echo RFC6455 echo, the
   real-server analogue of what each smoke test stood up for itself):

     - `init!` derives the demo server's own origin from
       `window.location.origin` (this page IS served by that same real
       server -- see scripts/demo-server.js), then performs a REAL, native
       `js/fetch` (the host browser's own fetch client, NOT the QuickJS-
       guest-shimmed `fetch()` below) against `/worker.js` and
       `/api/fetch-data` before the QuickJS engine ever starts. This repo's
       `:fetch-fn` contract is synchronous end-to-end (see
       `browser.net.http`'s `:cljs` branch docstring), so exactly like
       `quickjs_worker_smoke_test.cljs`/`quickjs_fetch_smoke_test.cljs`'s own
       `build-session`, the synchronous `:fetch-fn` this demo injects
       (`synchronous-fetch-fn` below) is a thin wrapper around these
       ALREADY-real-fetched responses, not a second, separate fabrication.
     - `sample-html`'s real `<script>` tags then really `new Worker(...)`
       (really re-fetches + really evaluates `/worker.js`'s real source in a
       SECOND, independent QuickJS context) and really `fetch(...)`
       (`:net/fetch` capability, delivered via the pre-fetched response
       above) -- both replies are eagerly captured synchronously and
       delivered into the calling script's `onmessage`/`.then()` chain by
       the NEXT `<script>` tag's snapshot install, exactly as
       `browser.compat.quickjs-runner`'s namespace docstring describes, so
       both round trips complete within ONE `session/load-html!` call.
     - WebSocket's real echo genuinely has to travel over a real socket to
       the real server and back, so it CANNOT complete within a single
       synchronous `run-page-scripts!` reduce over `sample-html`'s tags (see
       `quickjs_websocket_smoke_test.cljs`'s own docstring on exactly this
       point) -- `init!` instead drives it directly via two
       `quickjs-runner/run-script!` calls sandwiching a real
       `js/Promise`+`js/setTimeout` wait, the same real-wall-clock-time
       technique that smoke test uses, sharing the SAME
       `:script/generation` (hence the SAME page-lifetime runtime state,
       including `:websocket/handles`) as the page `sample-html` already
       loaded.

   Each proof lands in its own real DOM element (`#ws-proof`,
   `#worker-proof`, `#fetch-proof`) via a real `document.getElementById(...)
   .textContent = ...` mutation -- painted for real by the same WebGL
   pipeline as everything else on the page -- alongside the original
   `document.title` proof, which is left completely unchanged.

   ## Real generated content: ::before/::after, attr(), counter()

   A later session on kotoba-lang/cssom added real ::before/::after
   generated-content support to `cssom.core/apply-cascade`: a `content`
   declaration resolves quoted-string literals, `attr(name)` references
   (the real element's own real HTML attribute value), and `counter(name)`
   references (a real running per-document counter, mutated by
   `counter-reset`/`counter-increment` declarations walked in real
   document tree order -- e.g. CSS-only sequential `<li>` numbering), each
   individually proven via Clojure tests directly against cssom.core/
   cssom.layout (test/cssom/core_test.clj, test/cssom/layout_test.clj in
   that repo), but none were exercised by this demo's own `sample-html` at
   all.

   Wiring this up surfaced a real gap in THIS demo's own pipeline:
   pseudo-elements need an actual CSS RULE with a selector (an inline
   `style=\"...\"` attribute can only ever target the real element itself,
   never a generated pseudo-element box), so a real `<style>` block is
   required -- but `browser.session/load-html!` (the fn `init!` below
   already calls) was silently DROPPING its own `:css` argument before
   forwarding to `browser.core/load-html` (which already accepted and
   cascaded one), and `htmldom.core` treats a literal `<style>` tag as an
   ordinary non-rendered raw-text element (see `cssom.layout/
   non-rendered-tags`) -- its text is never extracted back out and fed to
   `cssom.core/parse-rules`. Concretely: writing a real `<style>` block
   into this demo's HTML would, by itself, do nothing at all through this
   demo's existing session/cascade path. Fixed `browser.session/load-html!`
   to actually forward `:css` (see that fn's own docstring for the small,
   additive, backward-compatible fix and how it was verified not to
   regress the one existing test that happened to already pass a `:css`
   string through it).

   `sample-html`'s new `#generated-content-proof` section below embeds a
   REAL `<style>` block (`generated-content-css`) -- syntactically the
   exact same real CSS text any real browser would also honor when
   rendering this exact page -- and `init!` ALSO passes that identical
   string as `session/load-html!`'s (now real) `:css` argument, so the
   SAME text drives the SAME cascade this demo's underlying engine
   actually runs, not a second, divergent copy. `#status-badge`'s
   `data-status=\"live\"` attribute is rendered through `[data-status]
   ::before { content: attr(data-status) \": \"; }`; `#step-counter`'s
   four real sibling `<li>` elements are numbered \"1. \"/\"2. \"/
   \"3. \"/\"4. \" purely by `counter-reset`/`counter-increment` +
   `content: counter(step) \". \";`.

   Unlike the WS/Worker/fetch proofs above (each a real DOM mutation,
   readable through `browser.dom-bridge`'s `:text-content`), a pseudo-
   element's generated content is never a DOM node or mutation at all --
   `cssom.core/apply-cascade` instead decorates the REAL element's own
   `:attrs` with a synthetic `:pseudo/before`/`:pseudo/after` style map
   (see that namespace's docstring), so this demo reads it back the same
   real way cssom's own tests do: `browser.dom-bridge/node-snapshot`'s
   `:attrs` key (not `:text-content`) -- see `pseudo-content` below."

(defn sample-html
  "The demo page's real HTML, parameterized on `worker-url`/`fetch-url` (the
   real local demo server's own /worker.js and /api/fetch-data endpoints --
   see `init!`, which derives them from `window.location.origin` and passes
   them in). Three real `<script>` tags:

     1. (unchanged from before this session) mutates `document.title`
        through the real dom/mutate capability path.
     2. really opens a Worker at `worker-url` and really calls
        `fetch(fetch-url)`, registering real `onmessage`/`.then()` callbacks
        that mutate `#worker-proof`/`#fetch-proof`'s real `textContent`.
     3. an intentionally empty script whose sole purpose is to BE the next
        `<script>` tag: its own eval-dispose/snapshot-install phase is what
        actually delivers script 2's queued real Worker reply and real
        fetch() response into those still-registered callbacks (see
        `browser.compat.quickjs-runner`'s namespace docstring, \"Real Worker
        execution\"/\"Real fetch() response delivery\" sections) -- mirroring
        `quickjs_worker_smoke_test.cljs`/`quickjs_fetch_smoke_test.cljs`'s own
        empty `script2`.

   Also embeds a real `<style>` block (`generated-content-css`) and a
   `#generated-content-proof` section exercising real ::before/::after
   generated content (`content: attr(...)` on `#status-badge`, `content:
   counter(...)` numbering `#step-counter`'s four real `<li>` siblings) --
   see this namespace's own docstring, \"Real generated content\" section,
   for why `init!` must ALSO pass `generated-content-css` as
   `session/load-html!`'s `:css` argument for this to actually cascade."
