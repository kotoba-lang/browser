;; The second JavaScript runtime, and the one that is not a foreign binary:
;; `kotoba-lang/org-ecma-international-262` is an ECMA-262 interpreter written
;; in Kotoba and compiled by amu to wasm32. QuickJS is a C program compiled by
;; emcc; this is the same shape with the C replaced by Kotoba.
;;
;; Its `:imports` and `:effects` are EMPTY, and that is a measured fact rather
;; than an aspiration: `kotoba -M check` on the engine reports `:effects #{}`.
;; It evaluates JavaScript and returns a value; it asks the host for nothing.
;; The DOM, fetch, storage and timers that the QuickJS descriptor imports are
;; supplied by `browser.compat.webapi`'s capability mapping, which sits ABOVE
;; a runtime rather than inside one -- so wiring them to this engine adds
;; imports here, and does not change the engine.
;;
;; Registering it does not make it the default. Root ADR-2608291400's gate G4
;; holds that until the same page script has been run through both and shown
;; to agree.
(defn ecma262
  "The JavaScript engine written in Kotoba and compiled by amu
  (`kotoba-lang/org-ecma-international-262`), offered as a second
  `:javascript` runtime beside `quickjs`.

  `:imports #{}` is not an omission and not a limitation waiting to be lifted.
  The engine reaches the document by RETURNING an effect log the host replays,
  not by calling out -- so there is nothing to import, and `kotoba -M check`
  answers `:effects #{}` even with `document` bound. Compare `quickjs` above,
  which needs twelve imports because it performs its own writes.

  What that costs, honestly: the guest cannot see its own writes (reads answer
  from the snapshot the host injected), and the only host object it knows is
  `document.getElementById`. Both are measured, in both directions, by
  `test/runtime-differential.cljs` against the quickjs build this would
  replace."
