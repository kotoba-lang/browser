(ns browser.net.http
  "Real host I/O for the `:browser.session/fetch-fn` / `browser.net` injection
   point.

   `browser.net` documents that fetch I/O is injected by the host: it owns
   origin/CORS/cookie/cache *policy* and calls a supplied `fetch-fn` of shape
   `{:url :method :headers :body} -> {:status :headers :body}` to actually
   move bytes. Every fetch-fn in this repo's tests up to now has been a fake
   (`(constantly {:status 200 ...})`). This namespace is the first real
   implementation of that capability: it opens a socket via the JDK's
   `java.net.http.HttpClient` (built in, no new dependency) and translates
   to/from this repo's request/response shape.

   This namespace intentionally does not know about origin, CORS, cookies, or
   caching — that policy stays in `browser.net`. It also does not follow
   HTTP redirects itself: `browser.session/navigate!` already implements
   redirect-following (up to depth 8) by inspecting the response status and
   `location` header and calling fetch-fn again, so the underlying HTTP
   client is configured to never auto-follow redirects.

   A real network failure (connection refused, unknown host, timeout, ...)
   never throws out of the returned fetch-fn: it comes back as a response map
   with `:status 0` and an `:error` keyword, matching the existing
   `browser.net` convention for non-HTTP outcomes (permission-denied and
   CORS-blocked responses already use `:status 0` + `:error`)."
