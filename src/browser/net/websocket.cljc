(ns browser.net.websocket
  "Real host I/O for the WebSocket capability (`:websocket/connect` /
   `:websocket/send` / `:websocket/close` in
   `browser.compat.quickjs-execution`) -- the WebSocket analogue of
   `browser.net.http`.

   Before this namespace, every `:websocket/connect`/`:websocket/send` in
   this repo was a pure host-side fabrication: `quickjs-execution` made up a
   `{:ready-state :open ...}` map and appended sent data to an in-memory
   vector, but no byte ever left the process and nothing could ever really
   come back. This namespace opens a REAL socket:

   - `:clj` -- `java.net.http.HttpClient`'s built-in `newWebSocketBuilder()`
     (JDK 11+, no new dependency): a real TCP connection, a real RFC6455
     HTTP-Upgrade handshake, real text frames on the wire.
   - `:cljs` -- the host JS runtime's own built-in, global `WebSocket`
     client (stable in both real browsers and modern Node -- also no new
     dependency, the same kind of \"real, already-there capability\" trade
     `browser.net.http`'s `fetch-async` sketch relies on for `js/fetch`).
     Unlike that sketch, THIS branch is genuinely wired up and used (by
     `browser.compat.quickjs-execution` via an injected `:websocket-fn`, see
     that namespace) -- but with one real, honestly-documented limitation:
     `drain-messages!` on this branch can only ever be a non-blocking peek
     at whatever has already arrived, never a bounded *wait* the way the
     `:clj` branch's can genuinely be. A JS host is single-threaded: the
     only way inbound WebSocket bytes ever get copied into `messages` is by
     letting the event loop run an `onmessage` callback, and busy-waiting
     this thread (there is no blocking `Thread/sleep` equivalent available
     to plain JS) would starve that very event loop, guaranteeing the wait
     sees nothing -- the same async/sync mismatch `browser.net.http`
     documents for `fetch-async`. The real wait has to happen OUTSIDE this
     function, at the caller's own async boundary (a real `await`/
     `setTimeout` between running one `<script>` tag and the next) -- see
     `test-cljs/browser/compat/quickjs_websocket_smoke_test.cljs` for how
     that plays out in practice.

   Every function here is deliberately shaped to be called from
   `quickjs-execution`'s capability-application code through a single
   dispatch function (`websocket-fn`, mirroring `browser.net.http/fetch-fn`)
   so that namespace never has to know or care which platform's real
   implementation it is talking to: `(websocket-fn {:op :connect ...})`,
   `{:op :send ...}`, `{:op :close ...}`, `{:op :drain ...}`."

        from a different thread than the one the JDK's internal I/O threads
        call these methods on) and records real close/error info into atoms.

        this repo's WebSocket subset only carries text, matching the
        `webapi-shim`'s `WebSocket.prototype.send` (always `String(data)`).

        Per `WebSocket.Listener.onText`'s own Javadoc contract, a real server
        is free to split any single logical text message across multiple
        WebSocket frames (fragmentation is normal, spec-legal RFC6455
        behavior -- common for large payloads), and `onText` is invoked once
        per fragment with that fragment's `data` and `last` false until the
        final fragment, where `last` is true. `data` is only ever THAT
        FRAGMENT's text, never the whole message -- so fragments are
        accumulated into `buffer` across calls and only the fully assembled
        message (the concatenation of every fragment since the last `last`)
        is pushed onto `messages`, exactly once per logical message, when
