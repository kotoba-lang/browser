  "The host side of the Kotoba ECMA-262 engine's DOM bridge.

  That engine (`kotoba-lang/org-ecma-international-262`) is pure: it has no
  capabilities and cannot touch a document. It reads from a SNAPSHOT the host
  injects and returns an EFFECT LOG the host replays. This namespace is the
  host half of that exchange -- build the snapshot, read the log, apply it.

      document ──snapshot──> engine ──effect log──> apply-effects ──> document'

  Nothing here evaluates JavaScript. That is the point: the authority to
  change the document never leaves this side of the line, which is why
  `browser.runtime/ecma262` declares `:imports #{}` while `quickjs` needs
  twelve.

  ## The wire format

  Both directions use the length-prefixed entry format the engine uses for its
  own environment, so neither side needs escaping:

      snapshot   <id>=o<len>:<node>       repeated, newest first
      node       textContent=s<len>:<text> then @<attr>=s<len>:<value>
      effect     <len>:<op><len>:<id><len>:<value>   repeated, in order

  An attribute is stored under `@name` so an element carrying one literally
  called `textContent` cannot shadow the property of that name.

  Two effects nest one more level, because they carry two values:

      16:addEventListener3:btn10:5:click1:0
      └ op ────────────┘└ id ┘└ 5:click1:0 ┘
                               └ type ┘└ n ┘
