  "Real QuickJS-backed `:browser.session/script-runner`.

  `browser.session/run-page-scripts!` discovers `<script>` tags and calls an
  INJECTED `:browser.session/script-runner` function for each one, then again
  for the `DOMContentLoaded`/`load` lifecycle dispatches. Historically every
  caller supplied a test-double runner. This namespace supplies a real one: it
  evaluates the script's actual JS source through a live QuickJS WASM engine
  (`browser.compat.quickjs-wasm/engine-from-session!`), lets
  `browser.compat.quickjs-execution` turn the engine's capability requests
  into real mutations of the session's document via `browser.dom-bridge`, and
  commits the result back into `browser.session` state via
  `browser.session/commit-script-state!`.

  ## What's real vs. stubbed right now

  This runner does not add capability handling of its own -- it wires up the
  engine + document + commit path so that whatever
  `browser.compat.quickjs-execution/apply-capability` already implements runs
  for real instead of never being reached. As of this writing that already
  covers real handling for: `:dom/query`, `:dom/mutate`, `:event/listen`,
  `:event/remove`, `:event/dispatch`, `:console/log`, `:storage/get|put|delete`,
  `:cookie/get|set`, `:clipboard/read|write`, `:window/open`,
  `:location/assign|replace|reload`, `:permissions/query`,
  `:geolocation/read`, `:notification/request-permission|show`,
  `:fullscreen/request|exit`, `:media/capture`, `:websocket/connect|send|close`,
  `:crypto/random-values|random-uuid`, `:worker/create|post-message|terminate`,
  `:broadcast/open|post-message|close`, `:beacon/send`,
  `:history/push-state|replace-state|traverse`, and
  `:timer/schedule|cancel|microtask`. Anything else falls through to
  `apply-capability`'s `:quickjs/unsupported-capability` error response (see
  that namespace for the authoritative, current list -- this docstring
  summarizes it but that `case` is the source of truth).

  Genuinely proven end-to-end (see `test-cljs/browser/compat/
  quickjs_script_runner_smoke_test.cljs`): a `<script>` that assigns
  `document.title = \"...\"` runs as real JavaScript in the real QuickJS VM,
  produces a real `{:capability :dom/mutate :dom/op :set-title ...}` capability
  request, and that request is applied against the session's actual
  `browser.dom-bridge` document and lands in the committed page's
  `:browser/title` -- not a mock, not an inlined stub.

  ## Runtime state threading across a page's scripts

  Every script / lifecycle-event invocation still builds a fresh
  `quickjs-execution/new-state` map, but it is no longer *empty* apart from
  `:document`: `run-script!` now rehydrates the page-lifetime slice of that
  state (see `persistent-execution-keys`) from whatever the *previous*
  script/lifecycle invocation within the same page load left behind --
  `:storage` (the script-local `storage/get|put|delete` capability; distinct
  from `browser.session`'s persistent script-source cache), `:clipboard`,
  `:geolocation`, `:dom/client-ids`, `:websocket/connections`,
  `:worker/instances`, `:broadcast/channels`, and `:history/entries` /
  `:history/index`, `:global/listeners`. A script that calls
  `localStorage.setItem(...)` (or opens a WebSocket, or registers a
  `document.addEventListener`) in one `<script>` tag is visible to a later
  `<script>` tag and to the `DOMContentLoaded`/`load` lifecycle dispatch
  within the same page load.

  The persisted slice is stored on the session under
  `:browser.session/quickjs-runtime-state`, tagged with the
  `:browser.session/page-generation` it belongs to (mirroring how
  `browser.script-engine`'s pending-start tracking tags its handles with a
  generation to detect staleness -- see `pending-matches?` there). `run-script!`
  only reuses the persisted state when its generation still matches the
  current page generation; `browser.session/commit-page!` bumps the
  generation on every real navigation/reload, which makes the previous
  generation's entry unreachable and the next script starts from a fresh
  `quickjs-execution/new-state` again. The `:document` key is deliberately
  NOT part of the persisted slice -- it keeps using its existing, separate
  threading path (each call re-reads `:browser.session/page :browser/document`,
  which already reflects every prior script's committed mutations).

  As of this writing, `:storage`, `:clipboard`, AND `:geolocation` reads also
  round-trip back into the VM itself, not just the host-side view:
  `evaluate!`/`load-module!` (`browser.compat.quickjs-execution`) pass the
  current `:storage` snapshot, plus host-computed `:clipboard` permission-
  decisions (read AND write, independently gated -- `quickjs-execution/
  clipboard-snapshot`) + text and `:geolocation` permission-decision +
  position snapshots (`quickjs-execution/geolocation-snapshot`), alongside
  the document snapshot into every `quickjs-wasm` invocation
  (`:document/snapshot`, `:storage/snapshot`, `:clipboard/snapshot`,
  `:geolocation/snapshot` on the request map), and `quickjs-wasm` installs
  all four as VM globals (`globalThis.__kotobaSnapshot` /
  `globalThis.__kotobaStorageSnapshot` / `globalThis.__kotobaClipboardSnapshot`
  / `globalThis.__kotobaGeolocationSnapshot`) before each eval, the same way
  it already did for `document.*`. So `localStorage.getItem` genuinely
  returns the real, current value synchronously -- a script that calls
  `localStorage.setItem('probe', 'x')` in one `<script>` tag makes a LATER
  `<script>` tag's `localStorage.getItem('probe')` observably return `x`
  to JS (proven via `document.title` in
  `test-cljs/browser/compat/quickjs_runtime_state_threading_smoke_test.cljs`,
  not just a host-side `:capability/results` log entry). The snapshot is
  frozen at eval start, so a script that does
  `setItem('x', 'y'); getItem('x')` within the SAME `<script>` tag still
  will not see its own write -- `setItem` only queues a `storage/put`
  request that the host applies via `apply-capability` *after* the script
  finishes, and the next fresh snapshot isn't installed until the next
  `<script>` tag's `eval-dispose!`. `setItem`/`removeItem` and the
  `storage/get`/`clipboard/read`/`clipboard/write`/`geolocation/read`
  requests `getItem`/`readText`/`writeText`/`getCurrentPosition` still queue
  alongside the synchronous snapshot read/resolve are otherwise unchanged
  from before -- they keep landing in `:capability/results` for the audit
  trail. `getCurrentPosition`'s `success`/`error` callback and
  `readText`/`writeText`'s returned promise are both settled SYNCHRONOUSLY
  (this engine evaluates a whole script synchronously in one pass, so there
  is no realistic way to defer either the way a real, async/
  permission-prompted browser would): `getCurrentPosition`'s `success` fires
  with the real position if permission is granted and the host ever
  injected one, `error` fires (with a `GeolocationPositionError`-shaped
  `{code, message}`) if permission is denied or no real position was ever
  injected -- see `quickjs-execution/geolocation-snapshot`. `readText`/
  `writeText` resolve with the real clipboard text / `undefined` if their
  respective permission (`:clipboard/read`/`:clipboard/write`) is granted,
  or reject with a `{name, message}` error otherwise -- see
  `quickjs-execution/clipboard-snapshot`.

  ## Real WebSocket I/O (opt-in via `:browser.session/websocket-fn`)

  `:websocket/connect|send|close` are fabricated (host-side-only, no real
  socket) UNLESS the session was built with a real `:websocket-fn` (see
  `browser.net.websocket/websocket-fn` -- a real `java.net.http.HttpClient`-
  backed client on the JVM, a real host-runtime-global-`WebSocket`-backed
  client in ClojureScript). When one is supplied, `run-script!` threads it
  into every `quickjs-execution/new-state` call, and `apply-capability`
  opens a REAL connection, sends REAL bytes, and (via
  `quickjs-execution/websocket-snapshot`, the WebSocket analogue of
  `geolocation-snapshot` -- computed the same way, before each script runs)
  drains whatever real text has genuinely arrived on that real socket.

  The one thing this CANNOT do is deliver a real inbound message to a
  script's `ws.onmessage` mid-script, for the same reason
  `getCurrentPosition`'s callback can't be deferred: this engine evaluates a
  whole script synchronously in one pass, and a real message arriving on a
  real socket at some future wall-clock moment cannot interrupt that pass.
  What IS genuinely provable, proven end to end in
  `test-cljs/browser/compat/quickjs_websocket_smoke_test.cljs`: the SAME
  QuickJS `vm`/context object is reused across every script tag on a page
  (see `quickjs-wasm/ensure-context!`), so a `WebSocket` instance -- and its
  `.onmessage` property -- that a `<script>` tag created really is still
  the same live JS object a LATER `<script>` tag can see (via a small
  persisted registry, `globalThis.__kotobaWebSockets`, that survives across
  evals the same way `globalThis.__kotobaSnapshot` already did). So: script
  1 opens a connection, registers `ws.onmessage`, and sends real data;
  real wall-clock time then has to pass (a real `<script>` tag boundary, or
  in the smoke test's case a real `await`/`setTimeout` between two
  evaluations); script 2's snapshot install drains whatever really echoed
  back by then and invokes that SAME, still-registered `onmessage`
  SYNCHRONOUSLY, before script 2's own source runs -- a real round trip
  provable ACROSS two `<script>` tags, never claimed to be same-tick async
  delivery the way a real browser's event loop would do it.

  ## Real Worker execution (auto-derived from the engine + `:fetch-fn`)

  `:worker/create|post-message|terminate` are fabricated (host-side-only,
  no real second JS engine) UNLESS TWO things are both true: the session
  has a real `:fetch-fn` (the SAME opt-in `:browser.session/fetch-fn`
  `:net/fetch` already uses -- a worker script is just another URL, see
  `quickjs-execution/worker-create-result`), AND the engine is a genuine
  `:cljs` `quickjs-wasm` engine (i.e. `(quickjs-wasm/worker-fn engine)` is
  non-nil -- the JVM `:clj` engine stub has no real second-context
  capability to offer at all, and any hand-rolled test-double `:engine` fn
  never has one either). Unlike WebSocket, there is no separate
  `:browser.session/worker-fn` opt-in flag REQUIRED for this: running more
  real JS inside a second, real, sandboxed QuickJS context has no external
  side effect the way opening a real socket does, so `run-script!` derives
  it automatically from whatever engine is already running (a caller can
  still override it via `:browser.session/worker-fn`, e.g. a test wanting
  a fake worker-fn double). `:worker/create` really fetches the worker's
  script over `:fetch-fn` and really evaluates it in a brand-new, real,
  independent QuickJS context (`quickjs-wasm/create-worker-context`) --
  NOT the page's own context -- with its own minimal `self`/`postMessage`/
  `onmessage` global scope (`quickjs-wasm/worker-global-scope-source`),
  kept alive across script tags (via `:worker/handles`, see
  `persistent-execution-keys`) until a real `:worker/terminate` disposes it.

  Message delivery is NOT symmetric with WebSocket, and genuinely does not
  need to be: `:worker/post-message` (main thread -> worker) delivers
  SYNCHRONOUSLY, immediately, as part of `apply-capability` processing that
  very request -- not deferred to a later script tag -- because unlike a
  real WebSocket's remote peer, the worker's context already exists,
  in-process, completely idle (the sending script has already finished its
  own synchronous pass by the time `apply-capability` runs), so evaluating
  a message into it right then does not interrupt anything running. Any
  reply the worker's script synchronously `self.postMessage`s back is
  captured the same instant. What IS still deferred, exactly like
  WebSocket: delivering that reply into the MAIN thread's
  `worker.onmessage` waits for the NEXT script tag's snapshot install
  (`quickjs-execution/worker-snapshot`) -- a real `postMessage` is
  asynchronous even when computationally instant, so this repo never
  claims same-tick delivery into the sending script's own `onmessage`
  either, mirroring the WebSocket precedent's discipline even though
  nothing here is genuinely waiting on real wall-clock time.

  ## Real fetch() response delivery (auto-derived from a real :fetch-fn)

  `globalThis.fetch` always returns a spec-shaped, `.then()`-chainable
  thenable (see `quickjs-wasm/webapi-shim-source`'s `__kotobaMakeDeferred`),
  but that thenable only ever settles for real when the session was built
  with a real `:browser.session/fetch-fn` (the SAME opt-in capability
  `:worker/create` already reuses to fetch a worker's script -- see
  `quickjs-execution/worker-create-result`). Without one, the thenable is
  registered but never resolved or rejected -- exactly as real, un-echoed
  WebSocket sends and un-replied Worker messages already behave today, and
  a script that never calls `.then()` on it (or reads its synchronous
  `.ok`/`.status`/`.capability` fields, unchanged from before this feature)
  is completely unaffected.

  With a real `:fetch-fn` injected, `:net/fetch` really performs the HTTP
  call (`quickjs-execution/apply-capability`'s `:net/fetch` case, via
  `browser.net/fetch-resource` when a `:net/context` is present, else the
  bare `:fetch-fn`). A real HTTP client call is itself synchronous/blocking
  (`java.net.http.HttpClient` on the JVM), so unlike WebSocket's genuinely
  unpredictable-arrival-time inbound bytes, there is nothing to wait for:
  the real response (status/headers/body) already exists in full the
  instant `apply-capability` finishes processing that `:net/fetch` request
  -- mirroring `worker-create-result`'s eager-capture reasoning exactly.
  It is captured then, keyed by the fetch call's own `:request/id` (assigned
  by the JS shim when it queues the request), into `:net/fetch-responses`
  (see `persistent-execution-keys`), and `quickjs-execution/fetch-snapshot`
  computes the JSON-safe snapshot the same way `worker-snapshot` does.

  What is NOT delivered same-tick, exactly like Worker's reply and
  WebSocket's echo: resolving/rejecting the calling script's fetch()
  promise waits for the NEXT script tag's webapi shim install (see
  `quickjs-wasm/webapi-shim-source`'s fetch delivery IIFE, which looks up
  each id present in the fetch snapshot against `__kotobaFetchPending` --
  the still-registered pending thenable a PREVIOUS script's `fetch()` call
  created). A real `fetch()` response is asynchronous even when
  computationally instant, so this repo never claims same-tick delivery
  into the calling script's own `.then()` either.

  Response body support is deliberately minimal: `.text()` returns an
  already-resolved thenable of the real fetched body (a real string, not a
  stream), and `.json()` is a thin `JSON.parse` wrapper over it. `.headers`/
  streaming bodies are NOT implemented -- documented follow-ups, not silent
  gaps, should a caller need them.

  ## Known limitations of this first pass

  - The QuickJS engine must already be started and `:ready`
    (i.e. the promise returned by `browser.session/ensure-script-engine!` has
    resolved) before `run-page-scripts!` runs. Starting the engine is
    asynchronous in ClojureScript (the WASM module load is a Promise) while
    `run-page-scripts!` is a synchronous reducer, so this runner does not --
    and structurally cannot -- lazily start the engine mid-reduce. If the
    engine isn't ready yet, scripts are recorded as skipped
    (history event `{:event :script/skipped :reason :script/engine-not-ready}`)
    rather than silently dropped or thrown. Callers must
    `(session/ensure-script-engine! session)` (and, in ClojureScript, await
    the resulting promise) before navigating / loading HTML."
