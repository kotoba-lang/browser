  position snapshot (already computed host-side by `geolocation-snapshot`,
  for the same reason), the real, current per-WebSocket-connection inbound

  each open connection's REAL socket -- see that fn), the real per-Worker

  pre-seeded randomness instead of always returning zeros/a fixed

  `invocation-with-snapshots` can hand it to `quickjs-wasm` as
  `:clipboard/snapshot` and the webapi shim's real
  `navigator.clipboard.readText`/`writeText` can synchronously
  resolve/reject the promise each returns with it (this engine evaluates a

  would -- see `quickjs-wasm/webapi-shim-source`'s clipboard shim). Mirrors
  `geolocation-snapshot` exactly, one coherent map carrying both the
  permission decisions and the value together (clipboard needs two
  decisions, not one, since read and write are gated independently).

  Uses the SAME `permission-decision-for` gate `apply-capability`'s
  `:clipboard/read`/`:clipboard/write` cases apply (via
  `clipboard-read-result`/`clipboard-write-result`) when they process the
  queued `clipboard/read`/`clipboard/write` capability requests AFTER the
  script runs for the audit trail -- with an empty `request` map, since the
  real `navigator.clipboard` JS shim never sets a custom `:origin` on either
  request either, so the two decisions always agree.

  Returns a single, JSON-safe map: `{:text \"...\" :read {:granted bool
  :error \"...\"} :write {:granted bool :error \"...\"}}` (`:error` only
  present when `:granted` is false, a short human-readable message mirroring

  `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` can synchronously call
  `success`/`error` with it (this engine evaluates a whole script
  synchronously in one pass, so there is no realistic way to defer the
  callback the way a real, async/permission-prompted browser would -- see
  `quickjs-wasm/geolocation-snapshot-source`).

  Uses the SAME `permission-decision-for` gate `apply-capability`'s
  `:geolocation/read` case applies (via `geolocation-result`) when it
  processes the queued `geolocation/read` capability request AFTER the
  script runs for the audit trail -- with an empty `request` map, since the
  real `navigator.geolocation` JS shim never sets a custom `:origin` on that
  request either, so the two decisions always agree.

  Returns a single, JSON-safe (plain string/number/boolean/nil, no
  keywords -- ready for `jsonable`/`clj->js`) map shaped one of two ways:
  - denied, or no real position was ever injected by the host (i.e. the
    `:geolocation` atom holds no `:latitude`/`:longitude` -- the
    `:geolocation` state key always defaults to a zeroed position via
    `new-state`, so this is really \"a test/host explicitly cleared it\"):
    `{:granted false :error {:code <1|2> :message \"...\"}}`
    (`1`/`\"PERMISSION_DENIED\"` mirrors the real
    `GeolocationPositionError.PERMISSION_DENIED`, `2` mirrors

  Clojure-side predicate key -- `browser.net-websocket-test`'s
  `quickjs-websocket-wiring-moves-real-bytes-through-apply-capability`
  already asserts this exact key against this exact map, so it stays) AND a
  second, plain `:closed` key with the identical value. The second key is
  not redundant: this whole map crosses into JSON via `quickjs-wasm`'s
  `jsonable`/`json-key` (`(name k)`, which does NOT strip a keyword's own
  trailing `?` -- `(name :closed?)` is literally `\"closed?\"`), and the
  webapi shim's real delivery IIFE (see `quickjs-wasm/websocket-snapshot-
  source`'s docstring) reads the drained flag back off the JSON'd object
  with a plain, dot-notation `__kwEntry.closed` -- a property name that can
  never contain a `?` that way. Without this second key, `__kwEntry.closed`
  is always `undefined` (falsy) regardless of the real connection's actual
  state, so a genuinely, really closed connection (a real peer-initiated
  close or a network drop -- not a `ws.close()` the SAME script already
  called, which the webapi shim flips `readyState` for locally and
  synchronously on its own) would never fire the script's `ws.onclose` or
  flip its `ws.readyState` to `CLOSED` -- the terminal state would silently
  read back as still-open forever from the script's perspective.

  `opened?` (a plain boolean, computed by the caller from `state`'s
  `:websocket/opened` dedup set -- see `take-websocket-opened-ids`) is
  carried under a plain `:opened` key (no `?`-stripping concern here,

  For every open connection that has a real handle (i.e. a real

  real text has arrived on that real socket since the last time anything
  drained it, waiting a bounded amount of time first if nothing has
  arrived yet (`:clj`) or just peeking at whatever has already been
  buffered by a real `onmessage` callback (`:cljs` -- see that namespace's
  docstring for why it cannot also bound-wait). This is why the JS-visible
  round trip this enables is provable only ACROSS `<script>` tags, never
  within one: a message that left the wire while script 1 was still
  running is, at best, sitting in the real queue by the time script 2's
  snapshot is computed -- there is no way for it to already be there
  mid-script-1.

  Without a `:websocket-fn` (the default), returns `{}` immediately --
  no connections ever have a real handle in that mode, so there is nothing
  to drain, and the webapi shim's delivery step (see
  `quickjs-wasm/websocket-snapshot-source`) is a no-op against an empty
  map, keeping every pre-existing fabricated-mode caller/test unaffected.
  `ws.onopen` is deliberately scoped the same way -- see
  `take-websocket-opened-ids`.

  `opened-ids` (from `take-websocket-opened-ids`) marks which of this
  snapshot's connection ids have NOT yet had `onopen` delivered.

  Returns a JSON-safe map keyed by WebSocket id string: `{<id>

  `:history-length` is a PLAIN INTEGER, not a live-updating atom the way

  actual `history.length`.

  NOTE (deliberately out of scope, not fixed here): this only seeds the
  STARTING value JS sees. This engine's `pushState`/`replaceState`/`go`/
  `back`/`forward` webapi shim methods still only mutate a VM-local
  `this.length` counter and queue `history/push-state`/`history/
  replace-state`/`history/traverse` capability requests that `apply-capability`

  (`history-push-state-result`/`history-replace-state-result`/

  `:history/index` -- note the `:history/*` namespace there is a DIFFERENT,
  unrelated key from this fn's `:history-length`). Neither model ever
  updates the other, and `browser.session` never consumes those capability
  results to actually move `:browser.session/page`/`:browser.session/

  `crypto.getRandomValues`/`crypto.randomUUID` can synchronously return the
  REAL pre-seeded randomness instead of always returning zeros/the fixed
  `zero-uuid` placeholder (this engine evaluates a whole script
  synchronously in one pass, so there is no realistic way to defer the
  result the way a real host RNG call would -- see
  `quickjs-wasm/crypto-snapshot-source`). Mirrors `geolocation-snapshot`/
  `notification-permission-snapshot`'s role in the threading, but simpler:
  crypto access is not permission-gated in a real browser, so this is a
  bare value snapshot like `storage`'s/`cookie-snapshot`'s own deref, not a
  permission-decision-carrying map.

  `take-random-bytes`/`take-random-uuid` below ALSO consume from these same
  state keys, but only AFTER the script runs, to build the
  `:capability/results` audit-trail entry -- this snapshot and that audit
  consumption read the SAME underlying queues in the SAME order (the webapi
  shim consumes its own client-side copy of this snapshot with a
  per-script-tag cursor that resets each time a fresh snapshot is
  installed, and the host then independently re-consumes its own state
  queue by the same lengths/count when it processes that script tag's
  `:crypto/random-values`/`:crypto/random-uuid` requests afterward), so the
  two stay in sync across script tags without needing the actual consumed
  values to be threaded back from the shim.

  With a real `:worker-fn` injected (see
