   `cssom.layout/default-theme` is a DARK theme (`:fg \"#e6ebf5\"` on
   `:bg \"#121724\"`) because cssom came out of kotoba-lang/wasm-ui, where
   it painted application chrome. A web page is a different thing: with no
   author `color` and no author `background`, every real browser paints
   black text on a white canvas — that is the UA stylesheet's `CanvasText`
   on `Canvas` in the default light color-scheme, and it is what the
   conformance oracle reports for a bare document.

   Rendering pages with the app-surface default made any page that sets its
   own light background — i.e. most of the web — paint near-white text on
   it. The repo's own visual smoke page was exactly that case: a `<main>`
   with `background: #ffffff` whose `<h1>` painted `#e6ebf5`, invisible,
   for as long as the smoke existed, because nothing asserted on a single
   painted op (see visual_smoke_model_test).

   A page that asks for `color-scheme: dark` still gets the dark theme; an
   explicit `:theme` from the embedder still wins over both."
